Complete oblig 1 2 3 for DATA1700
the program lets the user buy a movie ticket.
The user enters personal information that has input validation. After its valid it is sent to the server via post call.Then the server sends it to the h2 databse. To retrive it, thre is a get call to the databse to retirive the data and display it in the table. There is also a function to delete all data from the database.
I also adedd adress as a field even tough it wasnt a part of the assignment but i left it in there because it tought it wouldnt hurt.
The only thing that might not fully work is the input validation for the dropdown menu
