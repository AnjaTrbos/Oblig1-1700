This is  my enterpretation of the oblig 1 for DATA1700
the program lets you choose between 4 movies and a number of tickets.
Then you enter your personal infromation that has input validation. After its correct its an object sent to a list and then displayed. There is also a button to delete all objects from the list.
I also adedd adress as a field even tough it wasnt a part of the assignment but i left it in there because it tought it wouldnt hurt.
I also have alerts for selected movie and amout of tickets. This also probably wasnt neccecary but i decided to keep it in there just in case.
I also styled the input boxes to resemble the assignemnt more.
I am well aware of the mix of english and norwegian in this assignment and i know its not best practise i just got lost in it.
